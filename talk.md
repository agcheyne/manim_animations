Start with polarised electron hitting target, transferring polarisation

## Polarimetry
To begin with, let's take a step back and review what a polarimeter is in the first place.
A polarimeter is essentially a device that allows a determination of polarisation of particles.
### Recoil Polarimeter
Let's take a look at what happens when a nucleon comes near a nuclees of our polarimeter.

If we think about the orbital angular momentum of the incoming nucleon we see that depending on which side of the nucleus it approaches it will orientate differently.

If we now consider the spin-orbit interaction between the two, we see how this is a powerful technique.

There is a deflecting force arising from the spin-orbit potential of the system. If we manipulate this equation we can see that there are two terms dictating the direction of the resulting force.

The first term always acts radially but has its magnitude scaled by the a cosine term who is maximal at p x S
The second term is always in the direction p x S 

This leads to an overall preference for particles as a whole to scatter in the p x S direction. 

Here, we looked at spin up (which by scatter to the left)
But if we flip the spin then our p x S direction will reverse and we will scatter the right.


What about longitudinal spin? 
or Spin the y direction?

We can define our angular distribution by phi and theta and can construct an description of the resultant angular distribution of scattered nucleons. 

An incident beam of polarised nucleons will have their azimuthal distribution modified due to spin-orbit force interactions between the polarimeter nucleus and the recoiling nucleons.
### Spin-Orbit Interaction summary

Summary:
The spin-orbit interaction causes scattered particles to deviate slightly preferentially in a direction correlated with their spin orientation. 

By detecting this directional asymmetry, we infer the particle’s polarization.


### Analyzing Power
Definition: Analyzing power quantifies how sensitive a polarimeter is to polarization. It describes the strength of the correlation between the asymmetry and the spin direction.
Intuition: A high analyzing power is like a highly tuned sensor—it maximizes the measurable effect of polarization.
Formula: A=σup−σdownσup+σdownA = \frac{\sigma_{\text{up}} - \sigma_{\text{down}}}{\sigma_{\text{up}} + \sigma_{\text{down}}}A=σup​+σdown​σup​−σdown​​ where σ\sigmaσ represents scattering cross sections for different spin states.


The quantity ε(p, ϑ) is called the efficiency of the polarimeter and contains the detailed momentum and polar-angle dependence of the nuclear scattering cross section.
The quantity Ay(p, ϑ), called the analyzing power of the reaction, describes the proportionality between the polarization of the incident proton and the size of the azimuthal asymmetry. The analyzing power also depends on the proton momentum and
polar scattering angle and is determined by the detailed structure of the spin-orbit
interaction and its contribution to the total scattering cross section relative to other
components of the nuclear force







The cancellation of
the false asymmetries by reversing the beam helicity is a very important aspect of the
recoil polarization technique because it decouples the extraction of the polarization
transfer observables from detailed knowledge and understanding of the false asymmetry. Furthermore, since the induced polarization is zero in elastic scattering, the false
asymmetry can be measured using the sum distribution, and any possible effects of
a false asymmetry, however small, can in principle be corrected.
When the numbers of events in each helicity state are equal (N
+
0 = N

), the
cancellation of the false asymmetry also approximately holds for each helicity state
separately.

### Charge Exchange

What happens? In charge exchange reactions, a particle swaps its charge with the target nucleus (e.g., a proton becomes a neutron).
Relevance to polarimetry: These reactions are useful for neutron polarimetry because the exchanged charge helps transfer polarization information to a measurable form.


In an ideal polarimeter, the geometrical acceptance and the detection and tracking
efficiency are all independent of the azimuthal angle ϕ. In real life, however, a device of
the size and complexity of the FPP will inevitably exhibit some instrumental or false
asymmetries. These asymmetries will be minimized in a well-designed polarimeter
and a well-calibrated data analysis, but they are very difficult to completely eliminate.
The most important difference between the physical asymmetries resulting from the
polarization of the incident proton and the false asymmetries resulting from the ϕdependent variations in acceptance, detection efficiency, and tracking efficiency is
that the false asymmetries are independent of the beam helicity, while the physical
asymmetries change sign upon reversal of the beam polarization



The rapid 30 Hz reversal of the beam polarization guarantees very nearly equal
numbers of events in each helicity state. By forming sum and difference distributions,
the physical asymmetries and the false asymmetries can be separated unambiguously

### Form factor measurement 
What are form factors? Form factors describe the spatial distribution of charge and magnetization inside a nucleon. They’re essentially "maps" of its structure.
Role of polarization: Recoil polarimetry helps determine form factors by measuring the spin-dependent interactions of nucleons during scattering.
How? Different spin states and their resulting asymmetries give us detailed clues about the internal dynamics of the nucleon.

GEnRP
What is GEnRP? It stands for Generalized Electric Form Factor of the Neutron using Recoil Polarimetry. This specific experiment measures the neutron’s electric form factor using the techniques discussed.
Goal: To understand how the electric charge is distributed within the neutron, despite its overall neutrality.
How it works: Scattering experiments polarize the neutron. The recoil polarimeter measures this polarization to extract the electric form factor GEnG_E^nGEn​.


## Conlusion 
Proton vs Neutron
Key differences:
Protons are easier to work with because they are charged, so they interact electromagnetically, making them easier to detect.
Neutrons are neutral, requiring indirect methods like charge exchange to measure their spin polarization.
Challenge: Polarimetry for neutrons often requires more sophisticated setups but provides complementary insights into nucleon structure.
